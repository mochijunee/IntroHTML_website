      <p>These are a few of the dogs that have lived with me over the summer! I usually dog-sit small or medium dogs that don't shed, since I am allergic to most pets. I love walking and spending time with them.</p>

      <h2>WRITING</h2>

      <br>
      <p>This is the cover illustration for a short story I submitted to the Brooklyn Public Library's online writing contest in May 2022. The story follows a young woman who overcomes her fear of failure. It won 3rd place and is currently published in the New Utrecht branch and the BKLYNfuture blog.</p>
      <p>I write a lot in my free time, but this was just one work I wanted to share here. Writing was one of my first and favorite hobbies. Despite all the new things I learn and try, nothing will ever beat writing for me!</p>
      <br>
      <h2>MUSIC</h2>
      <p>I love listening to music and playing the violin! My top 3 favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar, Tyler the Creator, and Thunder cat. I also enjoy listening to Marvin Gaye, Joey Bada$$, Tupac, SZA, Doja Cat, Silk Sonic, Queen, and Michael Jackson.</p>
      <p>It's hard to pick a favorite song, so I don't. However, if I REALLY had to pick, it would be "SWEET / I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE" by Tyler the Creator. Give it a listen below!</p>
