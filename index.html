      <h2>WELCOME TO MY PERSONAL WEBSITE</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, there! I'm Audrey Yoo and this is my personal website, where you can learn a bit about me. 
        <br><br>
        I was born in Seoul, South Korea but I have been living in New York City since I was 2 years old! I'm an only child, and I live with my mom and dad in Manhattan. I'm a Virgo (September baby!) and my MBTI type is ENFJ-T. 
        <br><br>
        To learn more about my interests and hobbies, click "My Favorites" in the navigation bar above. If you would like to see my time management tutorial, go to "My Skills," as well. Also, don't forget to check out some of the best places to go to in NYC under "NYC Spots."
        <br><br>
        I hope you enjoy your stay and thanks for choosing my website.
        <br><br>
        See you later!
      </p>
